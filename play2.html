   <p class="speech">Oh, tell me of my father; I have lived
   But for this moment.</p>

        <h5 class="name">MORANZONE</h5>

   <p class="speech">We must be alone.</p>

    <h5 class="name">GUIDO</h5>

   <p class="speech">This is my dearest friend, who out of love
   Has followed me to Padua; as two brothers,
   There is no secret which we do not share.</p>

    <h5 class="name">MORANZONE</h5>

   <p class="speech">There is one secret which ye shall not share;
   Bid him go hence.</p>

<h5 class="name">GUIDO</h5> 

<p class="stage-direction">[_to_ ASCANIO]</p>

   <p class="speech">Come back within the hour.
   He does not know that nothing in this world
   Can dim the perfect mirror of our love.
   Within the hour come.</p>

<h5 class="name">ASCANIO</h5>

<p class="speech">Speak not to him,
   There is a dreadful terror in his look.</p>
