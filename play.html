        <h3>The Duchess of Padua</h3>

        <h5>ACT I
             The Market Place of Padua at noon_; _in the background is the great
             Cathedral of Padua_; _the architecture is Romanesque_, _and wrought in
             black and white marbles_; _a flight of marble steps leads up to the
             Cathedral door_; _at the foot of the steps are two large stone lions_;
             _the houses on each aide of the stage have coloured awnings from their
             windows_, _and are flanked by stone arcades_; _on the right of the stage
             is the public fountain_, _with a triton in green bronze blowing from a
             conch_; _around the fountain is a stone seat_; _the bell of the Cathedral
             is ringing_, _and the citizens_, _men_, _women and children_, _are
             passing into the Cathedral_.
        </h5>

    <p>
    <h5 class="name">GUIDO</h5>
    <p class="stage-direction">[_Taking a letter from his pocket and reading it_.]</p>
    <p class="speech">‘The hour noon;
    the city, Padua; the place, the market; and the day, Saint Philip’s
    Day.’</p>
        
    <h5 class="name">ASCANIO</h5>
    <p class="speech">And what of the man, how shall we know him?</p>
        
    <h5 class="name">GUIDO</h5>
    <p class="stage-direction">[_reading still_]</p>
    <p class="speech">‘I will wear a violet cloak with a silver falcon broidered on the
    shoulder.’  A brave attire, Ascanio.</p>
        
    <h5 class="name">ASCANIO</h5>
    <p class="speech">I’d sooner have my leathern jerkin.  And you think he will tell you of
    your father?</p>
        
    <h5 class="name">GUIDO</h5>
    <p class="speech">Why, yes!  It is a month ago now, you remember; I was in the vineyard,
    just at the corner nearest the road, where the goats used to get in, a
    man rode up and asked me was my name Guido, and gave me this letter,
    signed ‘Your Father’s Friend,’ bidding me be here to-day if I would
    know the secret of my birth, and telling me how to recognise the
    writer!  I had always thought old Pedro was my uncle, but he told me
    that he was not, but that I had been left a child in his charge by
    some one he had never since seen.</p>
        
    <h5 class="name">ASCANIO</h5>
    <p class="speech">And you don’t know who your father is?</p>
        
    <h5 class="name">GUIDO</h5>
    <p class="speech">No.</p>
        
    <h5 class="name">ASCANIO</h5>
    <p class="speech">No recollection of him even?</p>
        
    <h5 class="name">GUIDO</h5>
    <p class="speech">None, Ascanio, none.</p>
        
    <h5 class="name">ASCANIO</h5> 
    <p class="stage-direction">[_laughing_]</p>
    <p class="speech">Then he could never have boxed your ears so often as my father did
    mine.</p>
        
    <h5 class="name">GUIDO</h5> 
    <p class="stage-direction"> [_smiling_]</p>
    <p class="speech">I am sure you never deserved it.</p>
        
    <h5 class="name">ASCANIO</h5>
    <p class="speech">Never; and that made it worse.  I hadn’t the consciousness of guilt to
    buoy me up.  What hour did you say he fixed?</p>
        
    <h5 class="name">GUIDO</h5>
    <p class="speech">Noon.</p>
        
    <p class="stage-direction">[_Clock in the Cathedral strikes_.]</p>
        
    <h5 class="name">ASCANIO</h5>
    <p class="speech">It is that now, and your man has not come.  I don’t believe in him,
    Guido.  I think it is some wench who has set her eye at you; and, as I
    have followed you from Perugia to Padua, I swear you shall follow me
    to the nearest tavern. </p>
    <p class="stage-direction"> [_Rises_.] </p> 
    <p class="speech"> By the great gods of eating,
    Guido, I am as hungry as a widow is for a husband, as tired as a young
    maid is of good advice, and as dry as a monk’s sermon.  Come, Guido,
    you stand there looking at nothing, like the fool who tried to look
    into his own mind; your man will not come.</p>
        
    <h5 class="name">GUIDO</h5>
    <p class="speech">Well, I suppose you are right.  Ah!</p>
    <p class="stage-direction">[_Just as he is leaving the stage
    with_ ASCANIO, _enter_ LORD MORANZONE _in a violet cloak_, _with a
    silver falcon broidered on the shoulder_; _he passes across to the
    Cathedral_, _and just as he is going in_ GUIDO _runs up and touches
    him_.]</p>
        
    <h5 class="name">MORANZONE</h5>
    <p class="speech">Guido Ferranti, thou hast come in time.</p>
        
    <h5 class="name">GUIDO</h5>
    <p class="speech">What!  Does my father live?</p>
        
    <h5 class="name">MORANZONE</h5>
    <p class="speech">Ay! lives in thee.
    Thou art the same in mould and lineament,
    Carriage and form, and outward semblances;
    I trust thou art in noble mind the same.</p>
